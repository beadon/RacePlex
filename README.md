## Philosophy

This project is **100% open source**. The entire codebase—every feature, every parser, every visualization—is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and self-host.

- **Local Processing:** All data analysis happens in your browser. Your telemetry data never leaves your device.
- **No Server Required:** No uploads, no database, no accounts, no cloud sync.
- **Team Transparency:** Organizations can audit the code themselves for security compliance.

## Free Forever

- **Single file processing on HackTheTrack.net is always free**—no download or account required
- **Self-hosting is always an option**—clone this repo and run it yourself
- The only potential future paid feature: optional cloud storage for users who *want* hosted data retention on *my* infrastructure

## Admin Panel & Track Database (Optional)

The app includes an optional admin system for managing a community track database. When enabled, users can submit new tracks/courses for review, and admins can manage everything through a web interface.

**The app always reads tracks from `public/tracks.json` — zero database calls on normal page loads.** The database exists solely for the admin workflow.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Yes (if using Cloud) | Backend URL (auto-set by Lovable Cloud) |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Yes (if using Cloud) | Backend public/anon key (auto-set by Lovable Cloud) |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` | Yes (if using Cloud) | Backend project ID (auto-set by Lovable Cloud) |
| `VITE_ENABLE_ADMIN` | No | Set to `true` to enable admin UI and `/login` route |
| `VITE_ENABLE_REGISTRATION` | No | Set to `true` to enable the `/register` route |
| `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | No | Cloudflare Turnstile site key for track submission CAPTCHA |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | No | Cloudflare Turnstile secret key (edge function secret — `???`) |

> **Note:** `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is a server-side secret stored in Lovable Cloud, not a `VITE_` client variable. If not set, Turnstile verification is skipped.

> **Build fallback:** `vite.config.ts` now hardcodes the project's public backend URL, publishable key, and project ID as a fallback for production builds. Local `.env` values still take precedence, but published builds no longer white-screen if managed env injection is temporarily missing.

> **PWA cache recovery:** the legacy `/sw.js` path now ships a one-release cleanup worker that deletes old app caches and unregisters itself without touching IndexedDB telemetry/session data. The active offline worker is now published at `/service-worker.js`, and HTML navigations use `NetworkFirst` to reduce the chance of users getting stuck on an old shell after future deploys.

### Database Setup

The admin system uses Lovable Cloud (Supabase) for the database. The schema is created automatically via migrations. Tables:

- **tracks** — Track names with short names (max 8 chars) and enabled flag
- **courses** — Course definitions with start/finish and optional sector lines
- **submissions** — User-submitted tracks/courses pending admin review
- **banned_ips** — IP addresses blocked from submissions
- **login_attempts** — Rate limiting for login (5 attempts, 1 hour lockout)
- **user_roles** — Admin/user role assignments (uses `has_role()` security definer)

### Modular Database Layer

All database code lives behind `src/lib/db/` with a clean interface (`ITrackDatabase`). The current implementation uses Supabase, but you can swap in PostgreSQL/MySQL by implementing the same interface:

```
src/lib/db/
  types.ts            — Interface definitions
  supabaseAdapter.ts  — Supabase implementation  
  index.ts            — Factory: getDatabase()
```

### Admin Features

- **Submissions** — Approve/deny user-submitted tracks and courses
- **Tracks CRUD** — Add, edit, enable/disable, delete tracks (with short names)
- **Courses CRUD** — Manage courses per track with coordinate editing
- **Tools** — Build `tracks.json` from DB, download tracks ZIP, import JSON to rebuild DB, export/import course drawings
- **Banned IPs** — View and manage banned IP addresses

### Edge Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `submit-track` | Public endpoint for track submissions (with IP ban check) |
| `admin-build-zip` | Admin-only: generates per-track JSON files |
| `check-login-rate` | Rate limiting for login attempts |

### Track Short Names

Every track has a `short_name` (max 8 characters) used for:
- ZIP export filenames (`OKC.json`)
- Compact UI display in the header
- Falls back to `abbreviateTrackName()` for tracks without a short name

### First-Time Setup

1. Enable Lovable Cloud
2. Run the database migration (automatic)
3. Create an admin user via the auth system
4. Add the admin role: `INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role) VALUES ('<your-user-id>', 'admin');`
5. Set `VITE_ENABLE_ADMIN=true`
