 * this one interface, so download UI never has to branch on the transport. Each
 * logger ships an adapter that fulfils `LoggerConnection`; see
 * `fledglingConnection.ts` for the BLE implementation.
 *
 * Kept free of any transport imports (no Web Bluetooth, no Tauri) so it stays on
 * the eager graph without pulling a protocol bundle in.
